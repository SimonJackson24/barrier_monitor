ðŸŸ¡ Project Initialization Phase

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Created project roadmap
- [x] Created progress tracking system

## Next Steps
1. Set up basic Python environment and dependencies
2. Create initial GPIO monitoring script
3. Implement timing logic for state changes
4. Set up email notification system

## Current Challenges
- Need to determine exact GPIO pins used by Clipper LTE mini HAT
- Need to establish optimal timeout values for photocell monitoring

## Notes
